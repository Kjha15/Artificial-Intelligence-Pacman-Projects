Q1: I used stack function for solving DFS algorithm and used psuedocode's algorithm taught in class for developing logic

Q2: I used queue function for solving BFS algorithm and used psuedocode's algorithm taught in class for developing logic

Q3: I used priorityOueue for solving UCS and added one extra codition of stepcost in triples to get the cost of each state which was taught in the class

Q4: I used the same priorityqueue data structure and added heuristics function for adding the previous costs

Q5: I initialized all corners, updated values of coordinates of pacman. checked first if pacman is not in the direction of wall. If not, then I checked the successor state. If the successor state is corner then update value to true. I iterated this till each corner is not found.

Q6: 

Q7: For this, I calculated manhattan distance from the node to all corners. Then, calculated minimum distance from the corners to next state and removed it from the remaining corners. I repeated this method for next iterations.

Q8: I just called the breadthfirstsearch function 

I spent atmost 15 to 17 hours for question fifth, sixth, and seventh (developing logics and algorithms) and on rest of the questions I spent 6-8 hours. It took more than normal time for me to understand the questions.
